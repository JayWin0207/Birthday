        <p>It was 2023! <br></br></p>
        <p id='side-wish'>Here is how i wished you in 2023</p>
        <p>Finally the day has just arrived for which i have been waiting for days. It's your day Loose! Many more happy returns of the day ðŸ˜€. I always have a privilege to say that you are a very pure soul i have ever met. I dont know anything about our past lives but i am sure that we might have a very strong relation in the past life that made us to stick strong again in this life. I never wished for any one to stay in my life like i did for you. Please dont ask me why? I dont have an answer.

You had a special place in my heart
You have a special place in my heart
You will always have a special place in my heart and i mean it.

Everyone says that if you have a strong hope then that will happen for sure.

And as they said, i had a strong hope and that happened.(you know what it was)

I am short of words to wish you on your day because even if i  put all 26 alphabets together, i could not find a better sentence that matches the care i have for you.
<br></br>
Stay happy! Stay healthy! Even if you are not, i will make you don't worry.</p>
<p>Time united us again.Hence, I gifted you the same for this birthday</p>
